Introduction
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the
world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to
launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.
You’ve been hired as a data analyst by Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence (BI)
department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI
department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related
queries. Your first task is to load all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database
management system (RDBMS). Then, you’ll use SQL to analyze the data and answer any
ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.
Before you can begin your analysis and answer more complex business questions, you’ll
need to acquire a good understanding of the various data points. You’ll eventually compile
the results of your analysis into an easily digestible format, which will be presented to the
Rockbuster Stealth Management Board.
Key Questions and Objectives
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and
they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are
the main questions they’d like to answer:
● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

Context
To answer the questions posed by the different departments, you’ll query the data using SQL
(short for structured query language). Throughout this Achievement, you’ll learn SQL
incrementally, and you’ll use it to answer increasingly complex business questions for each
task. The results of your analysis will be presented to Rockbuster management, so you’ll
need to visualize the data in an easy-to-consume manner. In other words, you’ll build on what
you’ve learned in previous Achievements.
Although you’ll be working with data from the online video streaming industry for this
project, the skills you develop could be applied to any industry and will highlight your ability
to solve problems for a variety of clients. The aim is to give you hands-on experience with
SQL. By the time you finish your project, you’ll be able to use SQL to perform various kinds of
query-based analyses.
