Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores everywhere. But now, with competition from online streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime, they want to start their own online movie rental service. They hired you as a data analyst to help figure out how to do this. Your job is to organize all their data into a system, then use a computer language called SQL to answer questions like which movies make the most money, how long people rent movies for, where their customers live, and where they spend the most money. Your answers will help the company make decisions about what to do next. And as you work through this project, you'll get better at using SQL to solve similar problems in the future.
